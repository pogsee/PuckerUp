# PuckerUp
A web admin panel to administrate Puck servers, built on Go and HTML.

# Installation via script (Installs SteamCMD, Puck, and PuckerUp)
On your Linux server (note, only tested with Ubuntu 24.04, workarounds needed for Debian 13)
Grab the script with `wget https://github.com/pogsee/PuckerUp/blob/main/PuckerUp.sh`
Make it executable with `chmod +x PuckerUp.sh`
Run the script with `./PuckerUp.sh`
The script will present you with a URL to access, and your passwords.

# Manual Installation (PuckerUp only)
In progress. You will need to clone the repo, edit paths in the go files, run build.sh, and follow the relevant parts of the script.

# Credits
